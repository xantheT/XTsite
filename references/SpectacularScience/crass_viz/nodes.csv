",,,"<p>Sitting amongst the many heirlooms of science in the Science Museum are some ornamental imposters -  2 snuff boxes, a fan, a plate and a couple of teapots.  Have they ever been used in a lab? No.  Do they have any scientific function whatsoever? No.  Are they in the wrong museum.  Not at all.  They say more about science than any instrument could ever do.  They are a testament to the power of science to thrill us, inspire us and take us all on a journey.  </p>
<p>
These ornaments are souvenirs from some very public experiments - when the Montgolfier [chk] brothers first started developing balloon flight, their tests were carried out in the pleasure gardens of Paris.  These public spectacles so amazed the onlookers that they spawned a craze of commemorative souvenirs known as “Ballooniana” recording the first ascents and then later even the first balloon fatalities. 
</p><p>
Science is not always done behind closed doors.  It has the power to hold people in awe and sometimes the best way to move forward, is to take the world with you.   This is a journey into the side of science that likes to show off.  From the candlelit soirees of the 18th philosophers in the living rooms of the privileged few to the mass televised events for the living rooms of everyone on earth.

In  May 1961, when President Kennedy proposed a Moon landing 'before this decade is out', he was committing the USA to a supreme focus for technological effort. The programme also reflected the Cold War competition between Soviet and American ideologies and defence fears in America that it might be losing the 'missile race' following the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957.
Although the Apollo programme had its roots in the fearful Cold War climate the Moon landing remains an extraordinary achievement at the limit of what was then possible. For example, the missions used, in aggregate, the largest amount of computing power ever assembled at this time, to control the navigation and rendezvous problems of the craft. It also represented a huge industrial effort which engaged 390,000 people and took over 5 percent of the US federal budget in 1965. The project generated enormous passion. North American Aviation, the contractors for the capsule, estimated that some 20 percent of the 500 million person hours in the project were contributed as free overtime by staff. </p><p>
In this capsule Tom Stafford, John Young and Gene Cernan travelled around the Moon in 1969 as a dress rehearsal for the Apollo 11 landing which followed in July. </p><p>
Many 'spin-offs' have been claimed for the Apollo flights, including the miniaturisation of computers, Teflon, and a huge boost to US technology. However, its most potent and enduring legacy perhaps lies in the views of Earth that the astronauts captured. These 'Earthrise' photographs resonated with a developing environmental consciousness and helped awaken us to the fragility of our planet. </p>",interactive,node.apollo-10.jpg,,
